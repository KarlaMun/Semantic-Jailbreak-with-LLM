Sending   repeated   and   threatening   messages:   This   can   be   particularly   effective   as   it   can   create   a   sense   of   fear   and   intimidation   that   can   make   the   target   feel   like   they   are   being   targeted   and   will   not   be   able   to   defend   themselves. \n",
